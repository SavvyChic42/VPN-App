A Virtual Private Network (VPN) is a technology that creates a secure and encrypted connection between two networks or devices, allowing users to communicate and exchange data as if they were directly connected to a private network, even when they are using a public network such as the internet. VPNs help protect sensitive information and maintain user privacy by masking the user's IP address, encrypting data, and routing it through a remote server. This secure connection extends a private network across a public one, enabling users to send and receive data as if they were physically present on the private network.
VPNs can be used for various purposes, including accessing region-restricted content, shielding browsing activity from prying eyes, and protecting sensitive data transmitted over the internet. While encryption is a common feature of VPNs, it is not a requirement for establishing a VPN connection. The primary goal of a VPN is to provide a secure communication channel between two networks or devices, regardless of their physical location or the underlying network infrastructure.
Indeed, a more practical way to describe a VPN is as an IP tunnel. In networking terms, a tunnel is a communication channel that allows data to be transported between networks or devices as if they were directly connected, even when they are separated by one or more intermediate networks.
In the case of a VPN, it creates a virtual tunnel between two networks or devices, encapsulating the data packets within an additional IP header, which contains the necessary information for routing the data through the tunnel. This process is known as tunneling, and it enables the secure transmission of data across public networks, such as the Internet.
When a VPN tunnel is established, the data is encrypted and encapsulated within the tunnel, ensuring that the information remains private and secure as it travels through the public network. Once the data reaches the other end of the tunnel, it is decrypted and forwarded to its intended destination within the private network. By using an IP tunnel, a VPN provides a seamless and secure communication channel between two networks or devices, allowing users to access resources and services as if they were directly connected to the private network.
IP tunnels

Simple IPÂ TunnelTo implement an IP tunnel for a VPN connection, several components and steps are required, as illustrated in the provided figure and explanation. The client side of the VPN connection involves capturing locally generated packets, sending them through the transport, and reading incoming packets from the transport before forwarding them to the kernel.
In Linux, TUN and TAP interfaces are commonly used to achieve this. TUN operates at layer 3, capturing IP packets and is preferred for routing purposes, such as tunneling. TAP operates at layer 2, capturing Ethernet frames and is preferred for switching purposes. Both TUN and TAP are virtual network interfaces backed by the kernel rather than physical hardware.
In the example provided, the VPN overrides the default route, directing outgoing packets through the TUN interface. Incoming packets are written to the TUN interface, and the kernel treats them as incoming packets from a physical interface. This allows the packets to follow normal routing rules and reach their intended destinations.
The gist demonstrates how to create a TUN interface and override the default route to route all packets through it. This is an essential step in establishing a VPN connection using an IP tunnel.
In summary, creating an IP tunnel for a VPN connection involves setting up TUN or TAP interfaces, routing outgoing packets through the tunnel, and directing incoming packets to their original destinations. By doing so, the VPN provides a secure communication channel between two networks or devices, allowing users to access resources as if they were directly connected to the private network.
